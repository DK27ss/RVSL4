# RVSL4 - Modular Windows Post Exploit Framework

# Description

RVSL4 is a modular framework designed for electronic surveillance actions on computers running the Windows OS. It enables flexible and customizable post-exploitation, offering a set of tools to monitor activities and collect information remotely. RVSL4 is intended for surveillance purposes only and must be used in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

RVSL4 does not support multi-threading.

# ADDONS INTERNES

    - DESKTOP : Opens a server to receive the client's desktop stream in real-time.
    - WEBCAM : Opens a server to receive the client's webcam stream in real-time. (60 FPS)

# ADDONS EXTERNES

    - KLOG : Tracks keystrokes to analyze user interactions.
    - AUTOSCP : Automatically captures desktop screenshots at adjustable intervals and exfiltrates them to Discord with webhook.
    - DESKSCP : Captures desktop and webcam screenshots and exfiltrates them to Discord with webhook.
    - DWINDEF : Disables Windows Defender.
    - STLINFOS : Steals information and Discord tokens with Creal.

# USAGE

Start the C2 server with the following commands :

    python rvsl4.py <IP/DDNS> <PORT>
    Example : python rvsl4.py sha78221662145822.ddns.net 5555

Edit connection informations in the client file (cli.py) with the same IP or DDNS used to start the server to ensure your client connects correctly to your RVSL4 C2 server.

# OBFUSCATION

It is recommended to obfuscate your client file before building it to bypass antivirus detection. 
There is no single best obfuscation technique as it depends on the antivirus software used by your targets and the strength and method of your obfuscation.
There are many ways to obfuscate code, but here is a basic approach.

- With python modules

      pip install pyarmor            https://pypi.org/project/pyarmor/
      pip install PyObfuscator       https://pypi.org/project/PyObfuscator/

- With web tools

      https://pyobfuscate.com/
      https://development-tools.net/python-obfuscator/
      https://freecodingtools.org/py-obfuscator
      https://pyob.oxyry.com/

- With Github ressources

# BUILD

Once obfuscated, build your client file into an executable (cli.exe). Command to build via pyinstaller : pyinstaller --onefile --windowed FILE_NAME.py

![9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd435dfa-870b-4aa3-8dcf-b73e701adfd6)

After building, go to the 'dist' directory where your cli.EXE executable will be located.
Follow the same building and obfuscation procedure if you want to use EXTERNAL ADDONS, so they can be uploaded and launched directly from the C2.
